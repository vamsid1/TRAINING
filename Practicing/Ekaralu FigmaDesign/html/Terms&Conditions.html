         provided by the Website, now or in the future, they are agreeing to these Terms, as well as any policies, guidelines, and conditions of Ekaralu's service.

    </p>
    <h4>PLATFORM CAPABILITIES</h4>
    <p id="paragraph5">
        Our Website acts as a conduit for users to interact and conduct transactions with each other. Ekaralu neither participates in nor exerts control over any transactions between users on the<br>
         Website. The purchase and sale of agricultural or farmland contracts and services on the Website are governed by their respective terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph6">
        The Website simply provides a platform for users to reach a wider audience for buying and selling agricultural or farmland properties. Ekaralu merely facilitates communication and does not<br>
         participate in the sales contract between the buyer and the seller. At no point does Ekaralu hold any rights, titles, or interests over the farmlands, nor does it have any obligations or liabilities<br>
          concerning the contracts between buyers and sellers.
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph7">
        Users are permitted to upload and display images and information about their agricultural lands or services for sale on the Website. However, the display of such listings on the Website should<br>
         not be interpreted as an endorsement or advertisement by Ekaralu.

    </p>
    <p id="paragraph8">
        The availability of specific services on the Website's online platform is contingent upon users agreeing to additional terms, rules, policies, procedures, guidelines, disclaimers, notices, or other<br>
         relevant conditions, as applicable to such services ("Additional Terms"). In the event of a conflict between these Terms of Use and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will take<br>
          precedence for that specific service."
